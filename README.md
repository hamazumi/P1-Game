# **P1-Game**

## **About the Game**

A group of kids are at the park planning to play soccer and nobody brought a ball. Everyone goes into their backpacks to see what they can find to still kick around and help their soccer abilities. Being a hot day, everyone brought multiple bottles of water. They decide to make up a game to see how fast each person can kick randomly placed bottles in a given time. This allowed them to kick things around AND practice their reaction reflexes. They have to also be careful not to accidently kick anything other than the bottle that may appear at the park or their turn will be over regardless on timer.

Goal of the game:
To kick as many bottles as you can using (directional arrows) before your time ends. Player with the most bottles kicked at the end of their turns wins. If you accidently kick a chicken your points reduce.
